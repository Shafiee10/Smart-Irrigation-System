# Smart-Irrigation-System
## Overview 
This smart irrigation system project leverages an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with various IoT sensors to ensure optimal agricultural conditions. It monitors soil moisture and automatically activates a water pump when the moisture level drops below a set threshold. To manage environmental temperature, the system uses a DHT11(temperature) sensor: when the temperature rises too high, a fan is triggered to cool the area, and when it falls too low, a heater is activated to maintain optimal warmth. This automated approach ensures efficient water usage and temperature regulation, making it a reliable solution for modern farming.
## Real time Monitoring 
It Provides real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity through sensors, accessible via an interface
